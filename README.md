# Helix-Programming-language
A new programming language built for blockchains utilizing zero knowledge proofs, similar to Rust and snarkOS. 

# Key Features
- Compiler with LLVM backend, frontend for parsing new language syntax, and generating LLVM IR
- FFI for compatibility with Rust and Solidity libraries
- Standard library with common data structures, algorithms, and cryptographic primitives
- Ownership and borrowing system for thread safety
- Async/await support for concurrency
- Modular architecture and abstract interfaces for platform-agnostic design
- Standardized APIs for consensus mechanisms, execution environments, and storage models
- Integration of secure zero-knowledge proof libraries with best practices
- Comprehensive testing on various blockchain platforms, including stress tests

# Next steps
- Develop the compiler frontend and integrate it with LLVM
- Create an FFI for compatibility with existing libraries and tools
- Implement the standard library and concurrency features
- Design a modular architecture and abstract interfaces for platform-agnostic support
- Develop standardized APIs for consensus mechanisms, execution environments, and storage models
- Integrate secure zero-knowledge proof libraries, following best practices
- Test the language on various blockchain platforms, including stress tests
